Feeds
=====

This directory contains my curated list of RSS feeds as OPML files. You can
subscribe to the entire folder to get everything, or (more likely) to the
individual lists you're interested in.

* I keep various `daily funnies`_ here.
* Various interesting `tech blogs`_ go here.
* `Tech blogs from companies`_ are kept separate, to occasionally avoid promos.
* If you have similar taste as me, you might like my `music subscriptions`_.
* Whenever possible, anything I'm `actively reading goes here`_.
* You probably aren't here to follow the `folks I know`_.
