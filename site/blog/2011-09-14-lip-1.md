newspaper. Tired of the old design and the slow release schedule, we've resolved
to completely revamp everything; this year's paper will boast a team of regular
columns, will be releases every two weeks, and will feature more than just the
boring reports on school-sponsored activities of old.

Without further ado, I present: [Live! in Print - Volume 11, Issue 1](https://storage.googleapis.com/thekevjames-artifacts/lip1.png).
