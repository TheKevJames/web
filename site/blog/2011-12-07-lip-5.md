title: Live! in Print - Volume 11, Issue 5
tags: Live! in Print

Due to... creative differences and politics... issues 3 and 4 had a different
set of editors and designers than the first two issues. As such, the next Live!
I had any input in was issue 5, delayed about a month from our expected date.

This issue is the Christmas issue and features all of the regular columnists we
love, such as Alex Mark with "Write Angry" and Ryan Sherbo with (what do we call
his column, anyway?).

This issue also features a special article from yours truly. I'm so sorry.

Here you have it: [Live! in Print - Volume 11, Issue 5](https://storage.googleapis.com/thekevjames-artifacts/lip5.pdf).
