title: Summer Job at Cholakis Dental Group
tags: Untagged

This was my first formal job, and it went about as smoothly as you would expect.
I was really thrown into the deep-end here: though I'd done some coding and work
with computers, I'd never been solely responsible for medical-level network
security, large network administration, web development and maintenance, and
managing several graphics designers... (duh!)

I ended up doing a large amount of network analysis and security work. Before I
got there, the network had been a loose collection of various technologies which
had been poorly tied together, at best. Afterwards... well, they're called
"security standards" for a reason.

I also spent a good portion of my time maintaining websites -- of which there
were several, since CDG was the parent company of several smaller practices --
and designing new ones. This gave me my first taste of management, as well,
since the two designers I worked with were tasked with designing the resources
I would need for the websites.
