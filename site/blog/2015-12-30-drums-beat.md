      Poetry

Its been a while since I've had more than a passing moment to write. University
has been time-consuming and my hobbies have suffered. That said, it (writing)
is certainly something I want to get back into. Here's hoping that posting some
of my previous works will be enough to motivate me.

The drums beat.<br>
Driving us, pushing us,<br>
The Sun sets behind us.<br>
We don't halt, we don't rest.<br>
Continuing forward,<br>
To triumph or defeat.<br>
We, the children of old,<br>
Following the old ways,<br>
The old thoughts, the cycles.<br>
Knowing the story,<br>
The rhythm of life,<br>
Its rises and falls.<br>
We march, sent by the drums,<br>
To end it,<br>
To break free.<br>
It has happened before,<br>
And perhaps again,<br>
But there can't be peace,<br>
Without.<br>
