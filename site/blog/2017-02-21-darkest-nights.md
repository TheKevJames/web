Here's another one of my old works from years back. Still working on getting
motivated enough to write something new.

---

The darkest nights and brightest days<br>
Are when we throw our souls away<br>
For greed or lust or spite<br>
When Devils come to offer aid<br>
When Angels ever stay away<br>
In the darkness of the night<br>

For who will save a corrupt soul?<br>
A broken man who is not whole?<br>
A fell beast in disguise<br>
Not Angels high who care for nothing<br>
Nor Devils low who want for anything<br>
Nor those with weeping eyes<br>

For Angels live to serve their god<br>
Who would not deign on Earth to trod<br>
Who governs with indifference<br>
And Demons live not to defeat<br>
But to corrupt those on retreat<br>
Those with no resistance<br>

For yea, though forces watch o'er us<br>
They would not place in us their trust<br>
They would not care but to corrupt<br>
Their influence: abrupt<br>
Some care nothing but to destroy<br>
And who will save us from their joy?<br>
Not those who watch but act annoyed<br>
And no one can hide.<br>
