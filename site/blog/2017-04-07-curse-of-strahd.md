title: The Diary of a Confused Sorcerer
tags: Writing
      Dungeons and Dragons

As of this week, we've finally finished playing through a long-running
[Curse of Strahd](//dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/curse-strahd)
campaign. My original plan was to keep an in-character diary throughout the
adventure, but we drew out the game for far longer than I'd expected and that
plan fell by the wayside.

I stopped updating my journal after about eight in-game days (which took us
roughly six real-world months of once-a-week-or-less playtime). We completed the
campaign on day thirteen, so this journal includes a large chunk of gameplay, as
well as a bunch of musings on my backstory and the nature of being a sorcerer.
The bulk of it is complete and utter bullshit.

Enjoy!
