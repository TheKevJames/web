This year, I joined the team behind Live! in Print, our bi-annual highschool
newspaper. Tired of the old design and the slow release schedule, we've resolved
to completely revamp everything; this year's paper will boast a team of regular

boring reports on school-sponsored activites of old.

Without further ado, I present: [Live! in Print - Volume 11, Issue 1](https://storage.googleapis.com/thekevjames-artifacts/lip1.png).
